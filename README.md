# Building a CLI Application with Cobra

This project leverages the powerful Cobra library in Go to build a CLI (Command Line Interface) application. Cobra simplifies the design and implementation of command-line interfaces, providing a robust framework for developing comprehensive CLI applications.

## Installing Cobra CLI

Cobra CLI is a command-line tool that facilitates the use of the Cobra library. To get started, you first need to install the Cobra CLI tool.

```bash
go install github.com/spf13/cobra-cli@latest
```

This command installs the `cobra-cli` tool, allowing you to proceed to the next steps.

## Project Initialization

To initialize your project, execute the following command:

```bash
cobra-cli init <your_package_name>
```

Replace `<your_package_name>` with your project's full package name (e.g., `github.com/username/mycliapp`). This command sets up the basic structure of your project, laying the foundation for you to start developing your CLI application.

## Adding New Commands

To add a new command to your application, use the command below:

```bash
cobra-cli add <command_name>
```

Here, `<command_name>` should be replaced with the name of the command you wish to add. Executing this command adds a new Go file for the command to your project and automatically generates a basic command structure.

## Starting Development

With the Cobra framework now set up for your CLI application, you're ready to start development. Build upon the generated code to implement your commands and add functionality to your application.

Utilize the extensive documentation and community resources available for Cobra as you enjoy efficient development of your CLI application.
